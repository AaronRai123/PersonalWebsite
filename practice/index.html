  <h1 style="color:blue" backround-color: ="crimson"">I’m <em>Bradford Kimball</em>, and I’m running for Brookline Town Meeting in Precinct 1! 
  </h1>
  <h2>

    On Town Meeting, I will focus on two main issues: connecting residents with Town Meeting and ensuring that Brookline is coordinating with state agencies to to pursue our goals. As a student, education and the environment are major priorites of mine. I am committed to supporting Brookline’s schools.  I was proud to help Rep. Vitolo’s efforts to promote new eco-friendly building codes in Brookline, and I want to continue focusing on environmental issues. Brookline needs to be a leader when it comes to climate change. 

    I am so excited to be running, and I ask for your vote on May 7th. 

    <l>Thank you,</l></b>
